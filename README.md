# Dungeons of Doom

A game for my univeristy course work.

# Synopsis

The Dungeon of Doom is played on a rectangular grid, which serves as the
game's board. A human player, acting as a brave fortune-hunter, can move and
pick up gold. The goal is to get enough gold and then exit the dungeon. The
game is played in rounds. On each round, the player sends a command and if
the command is successful, an action takes place. A full list of the available
commands, the game-protocol, is available below.

The game ends either:
- When the player has collected enough gold and moves onto the exit square
- When the Bot catches (moves onto the same square as) the Player.
